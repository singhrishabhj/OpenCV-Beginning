# Draw geometric shapes on images

- Here we are going learn about how to draw different geometric shapes using openCV

# OpenCV Image Processing Example

Explanation will be added soon..


### Summary:

- `import cv2`: Imports the OpenCV library.
- `cv2.imread('image.png', 1)`: Reads the image from file.
- `cv2.line(...)`: Draws a line on the image.
- `cv2.arrowedLine(...)`: Draws an arrowed line on the image.
- `cv2.rectangle(...)`: Draws a rectangle on the image (filled if thickness is `-1`).
- `cv2.circle(...)`: Draws a circle on the image (filled if thickness is `-1`).
- `cv2.putText(...)`: Adds text to the image.
- `cv2.imshow(...)`: Displays the image in a window.
- `cv2.waitKey(0)`: Waits indefinitely for a key press.
- `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`: Closes all OpenCV windows.
